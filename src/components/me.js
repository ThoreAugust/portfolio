                <h1>Hi, I am Thore August,<br/> Developer from Germany.</h1>
                <p>
                    I found my passion for programming about {diff} years ago during high school but did not commit to a career as a developer until 2016. 
                    I moved to Hamburg, Germany to pursue my bachelorâ€™s degree in media systems at the HAW Hamburg which I started the following spring.<br />
                    During my studies I created some small projects with my peers which you can find on my github.<br />
                    I got my first and current developer job at Workplace Solutions GmbH in summer 2019 during my fifth semester. <br/>
                    Currently I am starting a blog about working as a developer struggling with media addiction.
